My implementation of the Vulkan tutorial from Alexander Overvoorde. I'm using this tutorial to learn deeper about computer graphics. I may use Vulkan in the future for some computer graphics or computer vision projects.

At this point, I can draw triangles in Vulkan. Two triangles form a rectangle:
